Assembly-Snake
==============

Snake-like game written in Assembly.

It is provided "as is".
The game must be compiled for Windows. It is a 16-bit software, which is
runnable in Window XP and below because since Windows Vista, it is no
more possible to run 16-bit application.

You need to create the .com executable file and then run it just like an
.exe file.
